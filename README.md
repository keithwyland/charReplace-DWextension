charReplace-DWextension
=======================

A simple Dreamweaver extension that replaces characters copied from Microsoft Word with the proper HTML. 

I created this to help out my teammates at work to be that much more efficient when using Word content from our internal business partners.

But I'm sharing it here in case anyone's looking to create their own simple Dreamweaver extension.

###Installation###

In Adobe Extension Manager, File > Package ZXP Extension. Then choose the .mxi file from this repo.

Then File > Install Extension and choose the ZXP you just packaged.
